This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the home page /comming soon route. the /about route is linked to on the nav. There is no content on the blogs route and the side bar only works on the home page.

To view the /github route you need to go to localhost:3000/github on your browser.

Dependencies: 
tailwind css 
apollo client which i did not us. 
react
react-dom
next

Things to change.
I had link to make my side bar to the right instead of left also my css reusing which was not done properly cause of time.
